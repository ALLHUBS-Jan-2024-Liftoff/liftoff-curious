            <p>
              Coders' Quiz is designed to help learners and new developers test and improve their coding skills through free, easy-to-take interactive quizzes. The platform provides multiple-choice questions on various programming topics, including but not limited to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, SQL, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technically, the application is built with a React front end, with Bootstrap style classes added as needed. The back end is built with Java and Spring Boot. It uses a MySQL database to store and manage the questions. The back end supports API calls from the front end, which fetches the questions and presents them in a structured, device-responsive test environment layout, which we call the 'quiz environment' in our quiz app. We also curate the question bank that we present in this application.
            </p>
            <p>
              To break the monotony of coding topics, we also provide an option for users to play trivia on generic non-coding topics. These questions, however, are sourced from an external API (Open Trivia Database).

                <p>Visit the home page, select a coding topic and the number of questions you want to attempt, and then submit the request.</p>
                <p>You will be redirected to the quiz environment page, where one question and four possible answers will be presented at a time. Select your answer by clicking on one of the answer choices.</p>
                <p>After selecting your answer, click the 'Save & Next' button to proceed.</p>
                <p>There is also a panel in the top left corner of the quiz environment that shows the current question number and provides buttons to navigate to the previous or next questions.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, you can navigate to any question from the question grid. Green indicates you have attempted the question, and yellow indicates you have marked or flagged it for review.</p>
                <p>The top right corner provides utility options: mark or unmark a question for review, toggle between dark and light modes, and listen to the question as the browser reads it aloud.</p>
                <p>The progress bar shows how much of the quiz you have completed.</p>
                <p>To help you keep track of time, there is a timer at the top that turns red when you have only one minute left of your allotted time (you get one minute per question, so for a 10-question quiz, the allotted time would be 10 minutes).</p>
                <p>When you have completed the quiz, you can submit it, or if you prefer not to continue, you can abort it at any time.</p>

                <p>You can download a PDF copy of your feedback by clicking the "Download PDF" button.</p>
                <p>You can also send an email to yourself to keep a copy of the feedback in your inbox. To do this, click the "Email Feedback" button, and in the modal that opens, enter your name and email address.</p>

                <p>Once you have selected all your answers, you can submit the trivia.</p>
