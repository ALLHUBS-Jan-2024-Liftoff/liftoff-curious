            <p>
              Coders' Quiz is designed to help learners and new developers test and improve their coding skills through free, easy-to-take interactive quizzes. The platform provides multiple-choice questions on various programming topics, including but not limited to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, SQL, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technically, the application is built with a React front end, with Bootstrap style classes added as needed. The back end is built with Java and Spring Boot. It uses a MySQL database to store and manage the questions. The back end supports API calls from the front end, which fetches the questions and presents them in a structured, device-responsive test environment layout, which we call the 'quiz environment' in our quiz app. We also curate the question bank that we present in this application.
            </p>
            <p>
              To break the monotony of coding topics, we also provide an option for users to play trivia on generic non-coding topics. These questions, however, are sourced from an external API (Open Trivia Database).
